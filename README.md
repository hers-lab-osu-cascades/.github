## About Our Lab
The Human and Ecosystem resilience and Sustainability Lab (HERS) Data Analysis Unit provides the rigorous statistical backbone for ecological research, monitoring, and high-stakes decision-making. We specialize in transforming complex, multi-scale environmental data into defensible insights that bridge the gap between field ecology and conservation policy. 

Our expertise lies in reproducible data science. By integrating long-term monitoring with remote sensing and advanced spatial modeling, we help partners navigate the challenges of climate sensitivity, population dynamics, and landscape-scale change. We don't just process data; we provide the clarity needed for adaptive management. 

The analysis team collaborates with the National Park Service Inventory and Monitoring (I&M) Division to design and implement data analysis plans for long term monitoring datasets. The team offers recommendations to NPS I&M on interpreting results and translating them into management strategies that support conservation decision making in and around national parks and protected areas.
